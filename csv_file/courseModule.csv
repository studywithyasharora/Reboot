When an electrical current flows through the coil inside the motor, it creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field interacts with a permanent magnet or another coil, generating a force that causes the motor's shaft to rotate. The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy enables the motor to perform tasks such as driving mechanical systems or creating motion. The direction of rotation depends on the direction of the current, while varying the current controls the speed of the motor. The rotation continues as long as the current is supplied, making the motor a reliable component for various applications.",4,e1f5bc12fcb648178fdcd18592cded60,fd1b8adf9fc1230f7b4c9e054aef2548
